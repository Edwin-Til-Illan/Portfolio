                        You may be wondering how someone get to learn so many different things ?
                        Well, first thing to know about me: I have an endless thirst for learning.
                        My curiosity have no bounds, and I have been studying automation at first right because I wanted to have a pluridisciplinal education.
                        But then, after I graduated from my 6 years long baccalaureat at the École de Technologie Supérieure school of Montréal, I still wanted to know more,
                        except I was a bored of school.I wanted to experience new things, but also get pay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Studying can be very stressful as you both have to worry for money and exams. So I decided to look for a job in automation. Unfortunately,
                        I still did not have my driving license passed, which make it a bit harder for me to find my very first job in automation.
                        Then, it just got even more difficult to find a job as COVID-19 spreaded around the world.
                        At this point I was really asking myself what I was going to do.
                        So, after a few weeks of wondering (and probably playing too much Zelda), I decided to do something.
                        Anything would be better than nothing, as I was unemployed since almost a month.
                        I wanted to help with the major international health crisis, except I was neither a nurse or a developer. So I tried to apply for essential industries.
                        But with the closing of all non-essentials services, more experienced engineers were available for employment. Bad times to get my first job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And that's when I started to really consider a reconversion. Or, at least improving my IT skills, so I could improve my employability.
                        With the help of my lovely girlfriend, I looked for different online courses, and finally selected a few AI programming courses,
                        but also data analysis and prediction courses. As I always feeled a bit overwhelmed with web development,
                        I started my self-teaching with a full stack web development program on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unaicorn/">Udemy</a>.
